          <p>A rogue-like game in which you defeat many different hell monsters in order to get out of the deep depths of Hell. Hades in one of the most played rogue-like games to exist as of right now. In the game you play as the son of Hades in which are to go through many different stages as you power-up and get stronger the more stages you go through. You are not the only one stronger as you go through stages, but the hellish monsters also get stronger. From experience the game is well done and fun as you keep going on and on. So I will give Hades a rating of 9/10.</p>
